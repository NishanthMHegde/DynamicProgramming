Dynamic Programming is a method of solving complex problems by breaking them up into smaller sub-problems, storing the solutions of the sub-problems into memory so that they can be re-used and then using the solutions to the sub prolblems to get the solution of the main problem. 
The steps to analyse start off similar to recursion but then we do not compute the sub-problems again and again, but instead we just store the solution in an array and re-use it when required. This saves cost of computation.
