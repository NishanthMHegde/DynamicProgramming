Problem: you are given a rod of length N inches and an array of size N+1 where the ith item represents the cost for ith inch of the rod.

Consider an example rod of length 4 inches and array:
0 2 4 7 8

0 inches cost 0 rupees
1 inch costs 2 rupees
2 inches cost 4 rupees
3 inches cost 7 rupees
entire 4 inches cost 8 rupees

Find the maximum profit we can earn by either seeling this entire rod or by cutting the rod.


Solution:

let us consider all possibilities:

P1: 1 inch + remaining 3 inches = 2 + 7 = 9 rupees.

P2: 2 inches + 2 inches = 4 + 4 = 8 rupees.


P3: 1 inch + 1 inch + 1 inch + 1 inch = 2*4 = 8 rupees

P4 : 1 inch + 2 inches + 1 inch = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 rupees

P5: entire 4 inches = 8 rupees

We can see that P1 has the highest profit. 

So how do we solve it?

Answer:

We need to maintain an array which consists of max profit for 0 to N inches. 

For each inch i=1 to N, the max profit will be rod[N] = max(cost[i] + rod[N-i]) 


Pseudocode:

//initialize an array of size N+1
function int(cost[], N):
int rod[N+1];

//for each inch we have to find the max profit. 

for i=1 to N:
	max_profit = -INF
	for j=1 to i:
		max_profit = max(max_profit, cost[j] + rod[i-j])
	rod[i] = max_profit

return rod[][]
